# BankLedgerConsoleAS

This console application was written with Visual Studio 2017 for a job application. The prompt was as follows:

     You have been tasked with writing the world’s greatest banking ledger. Please code a solution that can perform the following workflows through a console application (accessed via the command line):

     -Create a new account
     -Login
     -Record a deposit
     -Record a withdrawal
     -Check balance
     -See transaction history
     -Log out

     For additional credit, you may implement this through a web page. They don’t have to run at the same time, but if you would like to do that, feel free.

     C# is preferred but not required. Use whatever frameworks/libraries you wish, and just make sure they are included or available via via NuGet/npm/etc. Please use a temporary memory store (local cache) instead of creating an actual database, and don't spend much time on the UI (unless you love doing that).
